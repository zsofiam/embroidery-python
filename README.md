# Embroidery

## Story

Winter is coming, so does Christmas. You have a small enterprise
that produces Christmas tree decoration. This year you bought
a machine that is able to produce [embroidery](https://www.embroiderypanda.com/image/cache/data/A-A9933/Ornate-Christmas-Tree-Filled-Machine-Embroidery-Design-Digitized-Pattern-700x700.jpg)
and is controllable through a programmable interface.

The machine requests a matrix as an input where `0`
means an empty pixel, and positive integers mean different
colors.

Your job is to design simple ornament matrices for
this year's Christmas fair.

## What are you going to learn?

- think in algorithms
- handle edge cases
- use parameters and default arguments,
- use nested lists and advanced list manipulation


## Tasks

1. Implement the `draw_rectangle(width, height)` function to return matrices like this:
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 2 2 2 2 2 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 2 2 2 2 2 1          1 1 2 2 2 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 2 2 2 2 2 1          1 1 2 2 2 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 2 2 2 2 2 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
    - There are further optional parameters, `border_color`, `fill_color`, and `border_width`, all with default values of `1`.
    - Called with default arguments, the returned matrix is a `width`-by-`height` rectangle shape marked by `1`s.
    - The rectangle's border has `border_color`, and it is filled with `fill_color`.
    - The third optional parameter, `border_width`, specifies the width of the border.
    - There are no completely empty rows or columns in the returned matrix.
    - The function provides reasonable answers to edge cases (all combinations of integers as parameters).

2. Implement the `draw_triangle(height)` function to return arrays like this:
```
0 0 0 1 0 0 0          0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0          0 0 1 2 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0          0 1 2 2 2 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1          1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
    - There are further optional parameters, `border_color` and `fill_color`, all with default values of `1`.
    - Called with default arguments, the returned matrix consists of `height` rows and shows a tringle filled with `1`s.
    - The triangle's border has `border_color`, and it is filled with `fill_color`.
    - There are no completely empty rows or columns in the returned matrix.
    - The function provides reasonable answers to edge cases (all combinations of integers as parameters).

3. Implement the `draw_christmas_tree(blocks)` function to return arrays like this (when `blocks == 4`):
```
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 2 2 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0
0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0
0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0
0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
    - There are further optional parameters, `border_color` and `fill_color`, all with default values of `1`.
    - Called with default arguments, the returned matrix shows a Christmas tree made of `blocks` pieces of trapezoid blocks and filled with `1`s. Each block has 3 rows, and each first row is one step shorter than the last row of the block above.
    - The triangle's border has `border_color`, and it is filled with `fill_color`.
    - There are no completely empty rows or columns in the returned matrix.
    - The function provides reasonable answers to edge cases (all combinations of integers as parameters).

4. [OPTIONAL] Implement the `draw_circle(radius)` function to return arrays like this (truncated):
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0
0 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0
0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0
0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0
0 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 0
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1
```
    - There are further optional parameters, `border_color` and `fill_color`, all with default values of `1`.
    - Called with default arguments, the returned matrix shows a circle of radius `r` filled with `1`s.
    - The returned matrix shows a continuous circle outline of `border_color`, and filled with `fill_color`.
    - There are no completely empty rows or columns in the returned matrix.
    - The function provides reasonable answers to edge cases (all combinations of integers as parameters).

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Try to solve the problems without distinguishing border and the inside first
  (i.e. `border_color == fill_color`), you may find them much easier this way.
- This is especially true for the `draw_circle` function.
  Drawing a nice border for a circle is a rather advanced exercise,
  even though the only extra math needed for the solution
  is the Pythagorean theorem to calculate distance.
